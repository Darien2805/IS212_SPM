    <div><p>Welcome. This is a site about Ben and the sun. The sun did not shine. It was too wet to play. So Ben sat in the house, all that cold, cold, wet day. Ben sat there with Sally. They sat there, them two. And Ben said, "How I wish We had something to do!". Too wet to go out And too cold to play ball. So they sat in the house. They did nothing at all. So all they could do was to Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! And they did not like it . Not one little bit. </p>
    
    <p> And then Something went BUMP! How that bump made them jump!</p>

    <p> They looked! Then they saw him step in on the mat! They looked ! And they saw him! The Cat in the Hat! And he said to them, " Why do you sit there like that?"</p>

    <p> "I know it is wet And the sun is not sunny. But we can have Lots of good fun that is funny!"</p>

    <p>"I know some good games we could play," Said the cat. "I know some new tricks," Said the Cat in the Hat. " A lot of good tricks. I will show them to you. Your mother Will not mind at all if I do."</p>

    <p>Then Sally and Ben did not know what to say. Their mother was out of the house for the day.</p>

    <p>But their fish said , "No! No! Make that cat go away! Tell that Cat in the Hat you do NOT want to play. He should not be here. He should not be about. He should not be here When your mother is out!"</p>

    <p>"Now! Now! Have no fear. Have no fear!" said the cat. "My tricks are not that bad," Said the Cat in the Hat. "Why, we can have Lots of good fun, if you wish, With a game that I call Up-up-up with a fish!"</p>

    <p>"Put me down!" said the fish. "This is no fun at all! Put me down!" said the fish. "I do NOT wish to fall!"</p>

    <p>"Have no fear!" said the cat. "I will not let you fall. I will hold you up high As I stand on a ball. With a book on one hand! And a cup on my hat! But that is not ALL I can do!" Said the cat...</p>

    <p>"Look at me! Look at me now!" said the cat. "With a cup and a cake On the top of my hat! I can hold up TWO books! I can hold up the fish! And a little toy ship! And some milk on a dish! And look! I can hop up and down on the ball! But that is not all! Oh,no. That is not all...</p>

    <p>That is what the cat said... Then he fell on his head! He came down with a bump From up there on the ball. And Sally and I, We saw ALL the things fall!</p>

    <p>And our fish came down , too. He fell into a pot! He said, "Do I like this? Oh, no! I do not. This is not a good game," Said our fish as he lit. "No, I do not like it, Not one little bit!"</p>

    <p>"Now look what you did!" Said the fish to the cat. "Now look at this house! Look at this! Look at that! You sank our toy ship, Sank it deep in the cake. You shook up our house And you bent our new rake. You SHOULD NOT be here When our mother is not. You get out of this house!" Said the fish in the pot.</p>

    <p> "But I like to be here. Oh, I like it a lot!" Said the Cat in the Hat To the fish in the pot. "I will NOT go away. I do NOT wish to go! And so," said the Cat in the Hat, "So so so... I will show you Another good game that I know!"</p>

    <p> And then he ran out. And, then, fast as a fox, The Cat in the Hat Came back in with a box.</p>

    <p>A big red wood box. It was shut with a hook. "Now look at this trick," Said the cat. "Take a look!"</p>

    <p>Then he got up on top With a tip of his hat. "I call this game FUN-In-A-BOX," Said the cat. "In this box are two things I will show to you now. You will like these two things," Said the cat with a bow.</p>
    
    <p>"I will pick up the hook. You will see something new. Two things. And I call them Thing One and Thing Two. These Things will not bite you. They want to have fun." Then, out of the box Came Thing Two and Thing One! And they ran to us fast. They said, "How do you do? Would you like to shake hands With Thing One and Thing Two?"</p>

    <p>And Sally and Ben Did not know what to do. So they had to shake hands with Thing One and Thing Two. They shook their two hands. But their fish said,"No! No! Those Things should not be In this house! Make them go!</p>

    <p>"They should not be here When your mother is not! Put them out! Put them out! Said the fish in the pot.</p>

    <p>"Have no fear, little fish," Said the Cat in the Hat. "These things are good Things." And he gave them a pat. "They are tame. Oh, so tame! They have come here to play. They will give you some fun On this wet, wet,wet day."</p>
